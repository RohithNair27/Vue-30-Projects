# Vue 30 projects

## Hi Community

I am **Rohith K**, a software engineer currently learning Vue.js. This project was totally inspired by **Sam Lu's 100 Days of Swift** project. After reading his [Medium post](https://medium.com/@samvlu/100-days-of-swift-736d45a19b63#.ayz5vx6mc), I made the decision to dedicate every single day to writing Vue.js. 

## By Developers, For Developers

This repo does not merely follow tutorials; I re-build them with better code style and architecture design.
